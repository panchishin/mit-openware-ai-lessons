Search : Optimal , Branch and Bound , A*

The Best path instead of a Good path

Oracle				Case 1	Case 2
Branch & Bound			835	57
+ Extended List 		 38	35
+ Admissible Heuristic		 70	 6
A*				 27	 6



The oracle method involves asking someone who knows and trying to find a better solution that costs less by always expanding at the branch that has the least cost

The branch & bound search is the same as oracle, but without the initial someone

Branch & Bound ==
initialize queue -> test first path , if goal then done
		 	V--> extend first path
				if not already extended 
				sort by running cost + admissible heuristic
			--> return to "test first path"

An extended list is a list of paths that have been extended.  Don't extend a path that has already been tried and was previously found to have a lower cost.

An Admissible Heuristic is something like a weight, distance, or score.  Something which isn't absolutely better but likely better.  An admissible heuristic in checkers could be piece count.


Using an Admissible heuristic min remaining cost as well as the accumulative cost results in something better than Branch & Bound. 


Admissibility			Estimated Distance  x to Goal <= Actual Distance x to Goal
Consistancy			|  Est Dist x to Goal - Est Dist y to Goal  |  <= Distance x to y		

An Admissible heuristic can lead to a "pathological" incorrect solution when the problem space is not a map.
