Search : Depth-First , Hill Climbing , Beam

"British Museum Search" - search everything

Search != Maps

Search is about choice

Algorithm	Backtrack	Use Enqueued List	Informed	Limited Width
British Museum	no		no			no		no
Depth First	yes		yes			no		no
Breadth First	no		yes			no		no
Hill Climb	yes		yes			yes		no
Beam		yes		yes			yes		yes

Depth First Search ==
Initialize Queue	--> Extend First Path on Queue	--> Put results on front of queue --> Extend ...
Breadth First Search ==
Initialize Queue	--> Extend First Path on Queue	--> Put results on end of queue --> Extend ...

These are quite naive because they cover the same path.
This can be fixed by not extending nodes that have already been extended
This is called "use enqueued list"

A Hill Climbing search uses additional information ( and informed search ) such as distance, weight, or score to order the item in the queue.

Beam search is like Breadth first search with the informed search to limit the breadth of search.

========
Problems
========
* get stuck on a local maximum
* the "telephone pole" problem, where there are sharp spikes
* the direction of the nearest maximum is not in a direction or distance searched
